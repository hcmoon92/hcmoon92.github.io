# Flutter projects depend on Gradle, which in turn requires a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) version. If you're facing an incompatibility issue, here's how to resolve it:

## 1. Check the Required Java Version
- Flutter's Gradle configuration typically works best with Java 11 or Java 17.
- Gradle versions have specific Java compatibility requirements:
  - Gradle 7.x requires Java 11 or Java 17.
  - Gradle 8.x requires Java 17.

- Run this command to check the Gradle version:

```bash
./gradlew --version
```

---

## 1. Check Your Current Java Version
- Run the following command to see the Java version installed:

```bash
java -version
```


## 3. Update the JDK
- If your Java version is too old or too new, update it to a compatible version.
- Linux/Mac: Use a version manager like sdkman or install from the official JDK website.
- Windows: Download the correct JDK from the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK.
- Switch JDK Versions (Linux/Mac):

```bash
sdk install java 11.0.20-amzn
sdk use java 11.0.20-amzn
```

## 4. Set JAVA_HOME in Flutter
- Flutter's Gradle build process uses the JAVA_HOME environment variable. Ensure it's pointing to the correct JDK installation.
- Linux/Mac: Edit .```bashrc or .zshrc:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Windows:
- Go to Environment Variables and set JAVA_HOME to your JDK directory.

## 5. Clear Gradle Cache
- If you've updated Java or Gradle, clear the Gradle cache:

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

## 6. Sync Gradle Wrapper with Flutter
- Flutter projects use a Gradle wrapper (gradle-wrapper.properties). Ensure the version matches your Java installation.
- Open android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties and check:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.5.1-all.zip
```

- Update to a compatible Gradle version if needed.

## 7. Rebuild the Project
- Rebuild your Flutter project after making changes:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk
```

## 8. Validate Compatibility
- Run the Flutter Doctor command to confirm compatibility:
```bash
flutter doctor
```
